    description: "The Cupra Leon Sportstourer is the estate/wagon variant of the Cupra Leon, representing the first generation of this body style under SEAT's performance-oriented Cupra sub-brand. Built on Volkswagen Group's MQB Evo platform, it combines the aggressive styling of the Cupra Leon hatchback with the added practicality of an estate body. Distinctive design elements include copper accents, dark trim pieces, quad exhaust outlets, and sportier bumpers and side skirts. The Sportstourer offers 620 liters of boot space, significantly more than the hatchback's 380 liters, making it practical for enthusiasts who need extra cargo capacity. Powertrain options mirror the hatchback, including a 2.0L TSI petrol engine with outputs ranging from 245 HP to 310 HP, with the most powerful variants featuring 4Drive all-wheel drive. A plug-in hybrid variant (eHybrid) combines a 1.4L TSI engine with an electric motor for a combined output of 245 HP and approximately 60 km (37 miles) of electric-only range. The interior matches the hatchback with sports seats featuring copper stitching, a 10.25-inch digital cockpit, 10-inch infotainment touchscreen, and ambient lighting. Performance enhancements include sports suspension, progressive steering, and larger brakes, with optional Dynamic Chassis Control adaptive suspension. The Cupra Leon Sportstourer offers a compelling combination of performance, distinctive styling, and practical utility, positioned as a more exclusive alternative to mainstream performance estates. It exemplifies Cupra's positioning as a standalone brand offering emotionally engaging vehicles that blend performance with everyday usability."
